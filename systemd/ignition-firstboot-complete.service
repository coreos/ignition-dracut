# The MountFlags=slave is so we remount /boot temporarily writable;
# see https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/issues/1265 for the bigger picture.
# This option creates a new mount namespace; from the point of view of
# everything else, /boot stays readonly. We only have a transient writable mount
# for the lifetime of the unit.
#
# Also regarding the lack of `-f` for rm ; we should have only run if GRUB
# detected this file. Fail if we are unable to remove it, rather than risking
# rerunning Ignition at next boot.
