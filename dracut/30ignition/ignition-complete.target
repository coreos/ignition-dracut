# This target is reached when Ignition finishes running. Note that it gets
# activated *only* on first boot (or if ignition.firstboot=1 is provided).
# Thus, it is also an API for units to use so that they are activated only on
# first boot. Simply add a link under ignition-complete.target.requires in the
# initrd.

Description=Ignition Complete
Documentation=https://github.com/coreos/ignition
ConditionPathExists=/etc/initrd-release
Before=initrd.target

# initrd.target has OnFailureJobMode=replace-irreversibly, which seems to
# cause unit restart loops in the initramfs if one of our units fails.  Thus
# we intercept Ignition unit failures here and isolate to emergency.target.
